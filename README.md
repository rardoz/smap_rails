# SmapRails - a forward polyfill for ES6 Maps packaged for the Rails asset pipeline

ES6 Maps with a bunch of convenience methods packaged for the Rails asset pipeline. Smap.js was created by the awesome developer, [Eric Wendelin](http://github.com/eriwen). You can take a look at the original repo hosted here [https://github.com/eriwen/smap.js](https://github.com/eriwen/smap.js).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'smap_rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install smap_rails

Add it to your Javascript manifest file

    //= require promise

## Usage

Check out the smap js repo [https://github.com/eriwen/smap.js](https://github.com/eriwen/smap.js).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
